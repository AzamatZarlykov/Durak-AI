I am filled with a sense of gratitude and admiration for my supervisor Adam Dingle for his unwavering support and guidance throughout this process. His constant patience and dedication to helping in difficult moments have been a constant source of inspiration. His expertise and knowledge along with his willingness to go above and beyond to provide assistance have provided me with valuable insights, especially during the challenging times of writing my thesis. I am truly fortunate and lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from a such remarkable mentor. 

Moreover, I would like to thank my family and friends who have always been there for me during the process of writing my thesis. Their encouragement, advice, and participation in playing the Durak game to analyze the strategies have been invaluable to me and I am so grateful for a constant source of strength, and wisdom and for simply being there to provide a shoulder to lean on when I needed it the most.

% Abstract (recommended length around 80-200 words; this is not a copy of your thesis assignment!)
\def\Abstract{%
Card games with imperfect information present a unique challenge for many common game-playing algorithms because of their hidden game state. The objective of this thesis is to create a framework for implementing and testing various AI agents in the popular imperfect information card game ``Durak'' to identify the most effective approach in this environment. This paper presents a theoretical and experimental comparison of agents using various techniques, including rules-based heuristics, minimax search, and Monte Carlo tree search. In our analysis, we found that the Monte Carlo Tree Search agent performed the best among the implemented AI agents, whereas the rule-based heuristic agent and the minimax agent were less effective.

\section{User Documentation}
\label{userdoc}

The purpose of this attachment is to provide a user-friendly introduction to the game and its features. It is written in a way that is accessible to individuals without a technical background, enabling them to test the game without necessarily needing to develop AI for it. This attachment aims to furnish these users with the necessary knowledge and understanding of the game and its functions.

\subsection{Requirement}

In order to run various commands in Durak, the Windows 10 or Linux operating system is a necessary requirement. Additionally, the following software must also be installed:
